 hee_AJU.1.d:0 "Following the absorption of the lands of the state of Mogadishu into our sultanate, we have found several ways their proficiency in trade and administration can aid us. However, if we are to benefit from their strategic development, we cannot break from their economic system. It is therefore prudent if we let their mints run, and adopt their currency as a part of our empire's system of exchange."

The production houses, known collectively as \"toob menadir,\" produced woolen cloth specifically for the markets in Egypt and Syria.\nThe cloth traveled with merchants up along the Gulf of Aden, and was dispersed throughout the region on caravans.

 hee_ARA.1.t:0 "The Assassination of Pedro de Arbués"
 hee_ARA.1.d:0 "Having seen many religious practices spread across the peninsula since the time of the Romans, Iberia was traditionally a place of tolerance and coexistence. However, in 1478 Queen Isabella I of Castille and King Ferdinand II of Aragon received permission from the Pope to establish the national Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition to replace the papal Inquisition of the middle ages.\n\nOne of the first officers of the Spanish Inquisition was Pedro de Arbués, who relentlessly pursued heretics and \"conversos,\" Jews who had received baptism, but who were often suspected of still practicing Judaism. In 1484, his efforts earned him the position as the Inquisitor Provincial of the Kingdom of Aragon. \nIn Aragon the Inquisiton immediately became unpopular, as it was seen as an attack on the provinces' autonomy. Combined with Arbués' pursuit of influential converso families, he quickly attracted notoriety, and on the 14th of September 1485, he was attacked while attending mass.\nThe presence of conversos among the assailants sparked a movement against Jews, which saw more than twenty executions."

Although the king originally approved of the plan, he started to question Pérez' motives, and in 1579 arrested him. Many years would pass before Pérez managed to escape to Aragon.\nThere he made himself subject to the regional laws, the fueros, before going on trial before the justice of Aragon. As the court sided with Pérez, the king withdrew his accusation, but presented a new one through his official representative in Aragon. This time Pérez was sentenced to death, but ensured his safety by appealing to the notion that the king was overstepping his bounds and not respecting Aragon's sovreignity.\nAfter the legal process continued to drag on, the king tried to bypass the justice of Aragon by accusing Antonio Pérez of heresy through the Inquisition.As bypassing Aragonese law and custom was exactly what had angered the Aragonese enough to keep Pérez alive, they rose up in revolt. A fed-up King Philip invaded Aragon - formally his own domain - with Castillan troops, and put the chief justice to death without trial as a statement of authority.\n\nAntonio Pérez had already escaped to France and later England, and would die of natural causes in 1611."

Miguel Pellicer had his leg amputated two and a half years ago, and unable to work the fields he took to begging, but every night he would ask the priests at the Sanctuary of the Pillar for some oil to rub his leg, believing this to be a way to call upon the favor of the virgin. It must have worked, for this past Easter, Pellicer woke up one day with both his legs! \nNow, following a lengthy inquiry by priests and doctors, the archbishop of Zaragoza has pronounced it a true miracle!

 hee_ARA.10.d:0 "As Aragon and Castile were to be equals under the Spanish crown, but the King of the two countries hailed from Castile, the ancient laws and practices of Aragon had a special protected status. These stated that if the country should be ruled by a viceroy appointed by a foreign king, he must be Aragonese.\n\nAs this practice safeguards the people of Aragon from foreign influence, it contributed to the stability of the union.

Eventually he would become the official chronicler of the Kingdom of Aragon in 1548. He defined a new historic practice, where the Archives of Aragon alone were not enough, but sources from Rome, Naples and Sicily had to be referenced and compared to create a fuller historical picture of events.

However, he found both Lutheranism lacking, and even clashed directly with Calvin over his ideas of predestination. In the end, the letters he sent to Calvin proved fatal, as the reformer sent them to Catholic authorities to oust Servet as a heretic. Escaping from France to Italy, Servet stopped in Geneva to hear his opponent preach. Servet was arrested by the reformists however, and in an attempt to prove the orthodoxy of his movement, Calvin pushed to have him executed before Servet's Catholic pursuers could catch up to him.\n\nWithout this unfortunate end, Miguel Servet might have been the source of a reform movement of his own."

However, he continued in reading letters sent from Hell as a form of preaching and publishing unapproved books, the most famous of which is the masterpiece of Spanish literature known as \"El Criticon.\" Despite continuing to have trouble with his religious order, he became the defining voice of Baroque literature in Spain, and the main representative of the literary tradition of Conceptism."

When he was denied the right to preach in the church, his followers broke in and forced a compromise where catholic priests would preach in the morning, and Tausen in the afternoon. The bishop has found this unacceptable, so he sent armed men to imprison the rogue priest.

As the Danish Reformation continued to spread, Tausen was called to preach in Copenhagen.

 hee_DAN.7.d:0 "Reigning from 1588 to 1648, King Christian IV of Denmark and Norway was the Danish monarch that spent the most time in Norway, putting in much effort to improve the state of the subject country. While reforming the two countries' armies and economy, he was also an avid builder, and founded no less than four Norwegian cities.

 hee_DAN.8.d:0 "While the Danish monarchy was elective until the institution of an absolute monarchy in 1660, the eldest son practically always inherited the throne, and would often be elected before the passing of the previous king.\nHowever, the idea of an election left a powerfool tool in the hands of the Danish nobles, who still had to be placated to prevent them from causing issues with the succession.\nTo secure the recent [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s accession, we might want to ensure that most of the nobles get what they want."

This removed the traditional pretense of election in the Danish succession, but more importantly it allowed the king to abolish the \"Rigsraad,\" the group of nobles responsible for co-governing Denmark. Over centuries the council had become more and more difficult for the king, as it acted more in the interest of nobles than the monarch.\nNow it is finally time for the monarch to rule as they see necessary, just as God intended."

While initially disliked at court, he rose in power and used his influence to become the de facto regent of Denmark in 1771, when the king became too ill to govern at all. \nWhile in power, he attempted to institute extensive liberal reforms, issuing more than three cabinet orders a day. While his reforms were initially well-received, they soon became unpopular as they seemed to go against Danish values and traditions for the sake of abstract concepts of liberty. Struensee also had a relationship with the queen - herself a scandalous figure - who bore an illegitimate daughter.

No longer shall your background be relevant for whether you are able to receive a university education, as long as you have the intelligence to pass the entrance exams and the funds to pay for it. Similarly, state-run hospitals are now supposed to offer equal service to every person who comes to them in need.

While she initially disdained him when he first came to court, she grew to appreciate him, and even love him. Their affair while the king was incapacitated was no secret, but Caroline Matilda was never bothered by scandal, as she was used to wearing men's clothing in public and meddling in state affairs. Eventually she even bore Struensee as a child, even though Princess Louise Auguste was recognised as a child of the king."

Not only did this discourage trade and transportation, it made it so that it was often cheaper to import goods from abroad, rather than from a neighboring city.\nIt was also up to local signeurs to apply the taxation laws, which meant that there was no regulation on lords that charged far more than they legally should. In the middle of the 18th century, it was estimated that the cost of transporting 500 livres worth of wine from Muret to Paris was 501 livres, paying for dozens of tolls along the way.

 hee_NAP.1.d:0 "Pedro Alvarez de Toledo was the first viceroy of Naples to effectively govern the kingdom on behalf of the Spanish crown. While issuing grand construction projects and modernizing the country, part of the reason for his success was his firm rule and ruthlessness. Where previous viceroys had failed to exert control over the kingdom, \"Don Pedro\" closed down humanist institutions and instituted harsh penalties for petty crimes. He centralised national institutions, and moved every court to the Castel Capuano. By breaking up traditional land holdings, barons were forced to move to the city where they would be within reach of de Toledo’s government. \nHe failed in introducing the Spanish Inquisition in Naples, however, as revolts forced the Spanish king to retract the order. De Toledo passed away shortly after, in 1552, while on state business in Siena, ensuring that his legacy of state building would forever outshine the harshness of his rule."

The old walls were expanded and new ones were built along the seafront. Fortresses, shipyards and barracks were modernised and expanded. He also commissioned a new palace for the Viceroy, which was then surrounded by buildings in square-grid streets. The Spanish Quarter, as it was called, was the first of its kind in Europe, and is still one of the most distinct areas of Naples. The express goal was to make Naples invulnerable, but it also had the side effect of making it the second largest city in Europe at the time. By his death in 1552, the legacy of the harsh ruler as a city-builder was more than secure, and Naples would continue to be a center of southern European power for centuries."

The duchy’s involvement in foreign wars and conflicts far beyond its own borders made the mercenary armies of old difficult to maintain for longer campaigns. Instead, a general army was created, a standing force that would only ever answer to the Duke of Savoy, and continually train and develop between wars, rather than be disbanded. This was how Savoy established one of Europe’s first standing armies, helping the country survive the multitude of conflicts it was involved in."

That was how he came to lead the Spanish invasion of northern France, where he took revenge for his lost duchy by winning a great victory. The following peace treaty restored some of Savoy to Emmanuel Philibert, who spent the next twenty years using the conflicts between France and Spain to gradually regain territory from both countries. It is thanks to his victories on the battlefield he is remembered as \"Testa di ferro\", Ironhead, but he also worked hard to internally rebuild the state apparatus that had been lost in the French conquest."

Augustus guaranteed Saxon Protestantism however, and followed orthodox Lutheran doctrine in his dealings with other Protestant states. However, to guarantee future von Wettins for the throne of Poland meant that every possible successor had to convert to Catholicism, including the future elector Augustus III. Upon this the Estates of Saxony began protesting, threatening revolt in defense of the Protestant faith.

If I am the Sultan, I command you to come and lead my armies.\" Murad led the armies and won a great victory over the Christian coalition on November 10th 1444, ending the Crusade of Varna.\n\nMurad was not free to return to retirement, however. While the young Sultan attempted to establish his authority, Çandarli Halil Pasha, grand vizier and true governor of the empire, opposed him. The grand vizier found Mehmed too strongly influenced by his teacher, who Çandarli considered a rival.\nÇandarli arranged for dissent among the janissaries, who threatened with revolt unless Murad were to return to the throne. Still mostly a child, Mehmet acquiesced and Murad returned to once again rule the empire.\nHe passed away five years later, and Mehmet could once again take the throne, this time unopposed. Two days after Mehmet's greatest achievement, the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the Sultan had Çandarli put to death."

However, Ferdinando had died, and his successor was uninterested in continuing the colonisation project of his predecessor.

Jews were banned from from having intercourse with Christians, and Christians were not allowed to work in establishments owned by Jews. Eventually Jews were forbidden from living with Christians as well, along with being forbidden from visiting Christian prostitutes (no doubt to protect their Christian virtue).Being a Puritan, Cosimo's legal reforms affected Christian life significantly as well, banning May celebrations and beheading sodomites.\n\nIn his defence, he desperately needed the money he got from fining crimes that did not result in swift execution."

He did achieve many things, however, especially in guaranteeing legal rights for citizens, as well as through legislation and development of hospitals vastly improving the treatment of the mentally ill. This took place through the \"legge sui pazzi,\" the law of the insane, which was the first of its kind in Europe. \nA system for inoculation against smallpox was set up as an early predecessor of vaccination programs, and an early institution for the rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents was founded. Peter Leopold also approved and attempted to introduce a constitution in Tuscany, which would see greater rights given to its citizens, and ensure a balance between legislative and executive powers.\n\nThe constitution met fierce resistance, even from those who would benefit from it, and was never put into effect, as Leopold in 1790 moved to Vienna upon his ascension to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire."

In its first centuries it served as a \"bastion of Catholicism in the face of Protestantism\" as stated by its charter, but eventually non-catholics would be allowed to study there.
